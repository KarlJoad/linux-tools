# Linux Tools #
This is a collection of tools that I am collecting that are useful for making a Linux system do _something_.
Many of these tools are intended to perform "dirty tricks" with a subsystem to cause something to happen.

For instance, the `bin/sendRawEth` binary will send **raw** Ethernet packets to a destination MAC.
